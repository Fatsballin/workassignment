                 <li> CSS stands for Cascading StyleSheet. This allows developers to create rules that specify how the content of an HTML element should appear on the web page. 
                </li>
                 <Li>SS works by connecting rules with HTML elements. 
                    These rules dictate how the content is displayed by the browser
                    A single CSS rule is indicated by the opening and closing curly braces {} and contains 2 parts
                    selector
                    declaration
                    </Li>
